# Product Inventory Management System

## Project Description
The **Product Inventory Management System** is a C++ program that reads product data from a file, stores it in a structured array, and performs various operations such as:
- Displaying all product details
- Identifying the most expensive product
- Finding products with the lowest stock level

## Features
- Reads product information from an external file (`productData.txt`)
- Stores product details using a structured data type
- Displays product inventory in a formatted table
- Identifies and displays the most expensive product
- Finds and lists products with the lowest stock availability

## Installation & Setup
1. Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed (e.g., GCC, Clang, MSVC).
2. Place `productData.txt` in the same directory as the executable.
3. Compile the program using:
   ```sh
   g++ project1.cpp -o inventory_manager
   ```
4. Run the program:
   ```sh
   ./inventory_manager
   ```

## File Structure
```
|-- project1.cpp         # Main program file
|-- productData.txt      # Input file containing product data
|-- README.md            # Project documentation
|-- LICENSE              # License information
```

## Usage
Upon execution, the program will:
1. Load product data from `productData.txt`.
2. Display a list of products with their details.
